# Roof Plate Conversion Tool
This tool converts height measurements of a sloping roof into numbers of plates/sheets of material you would need to create the height. The output are plates that can be bought from the wholesale store.

## Motivation
I created this tool to help a friend of mine with his daily "chores" at work. It was a nice opportunity to practise my python and get a first glimpse into GUI development.
