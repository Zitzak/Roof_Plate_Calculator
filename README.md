# Roof plate conversion tool
This tool converts height measurements of a sloping roof into numbers of plates/sheets of material you would need to create the height. The plates to choose from are sizes of plates that can be bought from the wholesale store.

## Motivation
I created this tool to help a friend of mine with his daily "chores" on work. It was a nice opportunity to practise my python and get a first glimpse into GUI development.
